        <h4>Vegetables and Fruits</h4><br>
        <p>
        
        Purchasing, storing and cooking fresh vegetables can be challenging in a lockdown, especially when parents are advised
        to limit trips outside of the home. But wherever possible, itâ€™s important to ensure children are still getting plenty of
        fruit and vegetables in their diet.
        
        Whenever it is possible to get hold of fresh produce, do so. As well as being eaten fresh, fruits and vegetables can be
        frozen where possible and will retain most of their nutrients and flavor. Using fresh vegetables to cook large batches
        of soups, stews or other dishes will make them last longer and provide meal options for a few days. These can also be
        frozen where possible and then quickly reheated.

                <h2>Apples</h2>
                <p>Apples are high in fiber, which can help reduce the inflammation common during infections.
                    To turn apples into a more energizing snack, slice one up and enjoy with a spoonful of peanut or almond butter. Buy
                    organic or wash well before eating: a recent study found that a little water and baking soda removes pesticide residue
                    from the fruit.Bonus: theyâ€™re a superfood when it comes to satiety.
                    <br> 
                    Apples fight obesity, which is why you should never peel them. A compound called ursolic acidâ€”found in apple peelsâ€”is
                    believed to increase muscle and brown fat, a good fat that ratchets up calorie burn.

                    <h2>Bananas</h2>
                    <p>Other than being rich in vitamin B6, bananas are a good source of vitamin C, dietary fibre and manganese. Bananas are
                        also fat-free, cholesterol-free and virtually sodium-free
                        <br>
                        A medium banana will provide about 10-12% of your daily fibre needs. Singaporeâ€™s Health Promotion Board recommends a
                        daily dietary fibre intake of 20g for women and 26g for men.
                        <br>
                        Soluble and insoluble fibres play an important role in your health. Soluble fibre helps your body control your blood
                        sugar level and get rid of fatty substances such as cholesterol. Insoluble fibre adds weight and softness to stools,
                        making it easier for you to have regular bowel movements. This helps to keep your gut healthy and safe from harmful
                        bacteria.

                    <h2>Clementines</h2>
                    <p>Clementines â€” commonly known by the brand names Cuties or Halos â€” are a hybrid of mandarin and sweet oranges.Like its other family members, the clementine also happens to be rich in vitamin C, a vitamin that should be taken
                    externally as the human body canâ€™t produce it inside. Regular consumption of clementine fills your body with vitamin C,
                    thus keeping various diseases such as high blood pressure and hardening of arteries etc. at bay. Additionally, vitamin C
                    is also known to play a role in boosting the human immune system and fighting cardiovascular disorders.
                    <br>
                    The aromatic smell of clementine triggers the secretion of a substance, a neurotransmitter within the brain which
                    relieves stress and helps your body and mind to feel refreshed and energetic.
