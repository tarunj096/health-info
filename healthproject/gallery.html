        <br>
        <h4>Nutrition</h4>
        <p>
    Proper nutrition and hydration are vital. People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune
    systems and lower risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. So you should eat a variety of fresh and
    unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, protein and antioxidants your body needs.
    Drink enough water. Avoid sugar, fat and salt to significantly lower your risk of overweight, obesity, heart disease,
    stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.

        <h2> üå±-Food and nutrition tips during self-quarantine</h2>
    
        <p>
    As countries are taking stronger measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, self-quarantine and the temporary closing
    of businesses may affect normal food-related practices. Healthy individuals, as well as those showing acute respiratory
    disease symptoms, are being requested to stay at home. In some countries, restaurants and take-away offers are being
    limited and some fresh items are becoming less available.
    <br> 
    Good nutrition is crucial for health, particularly in times when the immune system might need to fight back. Limited
    access to fresh foods may compromise opportunities to continue eating a healthy and varied diet. It can also potentially
    lead to an increased consumption of highly processed foods, which tend to be high in fats, sugars and salt. Nonetheless,
    even with few and limited ingredients, one can continue eating a diet that supports good health.

        <h2>üçé-5 Food Trends That Will Define 'New Normal' Post Covid-19</h2
        <br>
        <p>
    
        A growing trend was seen last year of plant-based eating, as people were made aware about the multiple health conditions
        associated with a meat-based diet. The food industry has gradually shown interest & started adapting to mock meat and
        meat alternatives, with the biggest food chains opting for it to be part of their menus. Due to the Coronavirus outbreak
        in China, people have begun to think how they consume food. The 'thinking' involves getting to know more about how their
        food is sourced, made & finally delivered.

        <h2> üí•-Healthy Food - Foods to eat for being healthy during the coronavirus outbreak</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Vegetables and Fruits</h4><br>
        <p>
    
            Purchasing, storing and cooking fresh vegetables can be challenging in a lockdown, especially when parents are
            advised
            to limit trips outside of the home. But wherever possible, it‚Äôs important to ensure children are still getting
            plenty of
            fruit and vegetables in their diet.
    
            Whenever it is possible to get hold of fresh produce, do so. As well as being eaten fresh, fruits and vegetables
            can be
            frozen where possible and will retain most of their nutrients and flavor. Using fresh vegetables to cook large
            batches
            of soups, stews or other dishes will make them last longer and provide meal options for a few days. These can
            also be
            frozen where possible and then quickly reheated.
